Changes in flexmix version 1.1-0

  o The FLXglm driver now has an offset argument.

  o New data set seizure as example for a Poisson GLM
    with an offset.

  o fitted() can be used to extract fitted values from flexmix
    and FLXrefit objects.

  o New accessor methods cluster() and posterior().

  o The package now uses lazy loading and has a namespace.


Changes in flexmix version 1.0-0

  o The package has now an introductionary vignette which can be
    accessed using the command vignette("flexmix-intro"). The vignette
    has been published in the Journal of Statistical Software, Volume
    11, Issue 8 (www.jstatsoft.org), and the paper should be used as
    citation for flexmix, run citation("flexmix") in R 2.0.0 or newer
    for details.

  o Several typos in help pages have been fixed.
  
	
Changes in flexmix version 0.9-1

  o Adjust for R 2.0.0.

  o Fixed a bug in the summary and plot methods of flexmix objects in
    case of empty clusters.

  o stepFlexmix takes two new arguments: `compare' allows fo find
    minimum AIC/BIC solutions in addition to maximum likelihood,
    `verbose' gives some information about progress.

  o Use a default of verbose=0 in FLXcontrol (better in combination 
    with stepFlexmix). 

	
Changes in flexmix version 0.9-0

  o new summary() and plot() methods for flexmix objects

  o FLXglm objects can now be automatically refit()ted to get table of
    significance tests for coefficients

  o new function stepFlexmix() for more automated model search

  o the artificial example data now have functions to
    create them and a pre-stored data sets, new function plotEll() to
    plot 2d Gaussians with confidence ellipses.

  o new function KLdiv() to compute Kullback-Leibler divergence of
    components

  o the calculation of the degrees of freedom for FLXmclust was wrong


Changes in flexmix version 0.7-1

  o fixed some codoc problems (missing aliases)
