Changes in flexmix version 0.9-1

  o Adjust for R 2.0.0.

  o Fixed a bug in the summary and plot methods of flexmix objects in
    case of empty clusters.

  o stepFlexmix takes two new arguments: `compare' allows fo find
    minimum AIC/BIC solutions in addition to maximum likelihood,
    `verbose' gives some information about progress.

  o Use a default of verbose=0 in FLXcontrol (better in combination 
    with stepFlexmix).
